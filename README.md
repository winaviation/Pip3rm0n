<h1 align="center">DISCLAIMER</h1>

<p align="center">Jailbreaking your iOS device involves bypassing Apple's built-in restrictions, which can grant additional features and customization options. However, this process carries several risks: it voids any existing warranty or support agreements with Apple, making you ineligible for service or repairs; it exposes your device to potential security vulnerabilities, including malware and data breaches; it may lead to system instability, causing crashes or performance issues; and future iOS updates might not be compatible with your jailbroken device, complicating the process of updating or restoring it. Additionally, while jailbreaking is legal in some regions, it may be restricted or illegal in others, so it's crucial to understand the legal implications in your area. <b>I am not responsible for any damage, data loss, security issues, or legal consequences that may arise from jailbreaking your device. By proceeding with a jailbreak, you acknowledge and accept all associated risks and responsibilities.</b></p>

# Supported Environments
Pip3rm0n can run on Windows 7 or later, on Linux, on Raspberry Pie, on Termux or a Flipper Zero running linux.

# Requirements
Pip3rm0n requires Python 3 with the following libraries installed via PIP:
- tkinter
- webbrowser
- os
- random
- Pillow 10
- zlib
- Python

# Usage
Click on `START` right in the middle of the GUI, you may wanna use some options you may like, for example, curing pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis (most underrated option).

# How it works
Pip3rm0n uses **a WiFi based kernel exploit** made by my friend, the exploit currently has no name but I like to call it Wipl0it.
Some files will be downloaded server-side when you click on `START`.

Pip3rm0n also provides "Hack a mainframe" tool, using the same mainframe hacking API Pip3rm0n used to hack Apple's mainframe to block updates.

# Credits
Huge thanks to r/JelBrek and r/masterhacker for inspiring me to make this project!
